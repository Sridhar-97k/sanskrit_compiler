Abstract:
The requirement for a Natural Language to be used as a programming language has been discussed for many years, yet we still are finding answers to the same question. Most of the current work in this area is limited to English and a few other oriental languages, as a result of which we are susceptible to ambiguity in its interpretation due to the weak grammatical structure of these languages. Although there are thousands of languages spoken worldwide and we haven't tested all of them, we still can get a strong contender for this argument. To answer this question, this paper proposes the use of Sanskrit language as a programming language which has the most substantial ancient roots and offers a robust grammatical foundation, which will help us achieve a natural language to be used as a computational language. This paper deals with an approach to demonstrate how Sanskrit could be a solid contender to be a natural language used as a programming language by mapping it to the compiler's phases.
